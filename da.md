# Day 35 Task: Managing Persistent Volumes in Your Deployment
ðŸ™Œ Kudos to you for conquering ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes yesterday.

ðŸ”¥ You're on fire! ðŸ”¥

## What are Persistent Volumes in k8s
In Kubernetes, a Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. The PVC references the PV, and the PV is bound to a specific node. Read official documentation of [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). 

## Today's tasks:
### Task 1:
Add a Persistent Volume to your Deployment todo app.
- Create a Persistent Volume using a file on your node. [Template]()
- Create a Persistent Volume Claim that references the Persistent Volume. [Template]()
- Update your deployment.yml file to include the Persistent Volume Claim. After Applying pv.yml pvc.yml your deployment file look like this [Template]()
- Apply the updated deployment using the command: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`
- Verify that the Persistent Volume has been added to your Deployment by checking the status of the Pods and Persistent Volumes in your cluster. Use this commands `kubectl get pods` ,
`kubectl get pv`
Note : Now You know how to apply any file in k8s

### Task 2:
Accessing data in the Persistent Volume,
- Connect to a Pod in your Deployment using command : `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
`
- Verify that you can access the data stored in the Persistent Volume from within the Pod
