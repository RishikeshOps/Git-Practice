# Day 43: EC2 and S3 for Beginners üíª üìÅ
Today we will be exploring two of the most commonly used services in AWS, EC2 and S3, as part of the 90 Days of DevOps Challenge.## 

# EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. Essentially, it allows you to rent virtual computers to run your applications and services. With EC2, you can launch virtual machines, called instances, and configure security and network settings.

# S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that provides a secure and scalable way to store and access data on the cloud. It is designed for storing any kind of data, such as text files, images, videos, backups, and more.

## Task-01
- Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console and connect to it using Secure Shell (SSH).
- Create an S3 bucket and upload a file to it using the AWS Management Console.
- Access the file from the EC2 instance using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
## Task-02
- Create a snapshot of the EC2 instance and use it to launch a new EC2 instance.
- Download a file from the S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.
- Verify that the contents of the file are the same on both EC2 instances.

Let me know if you have any questions or face any issues while doing the tasks.

Happy Learning!
