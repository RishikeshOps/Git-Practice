# Day 28 Task: Create a new Jenkins agent as a service 

  

Day 27 was all about a Declarative pipeline, now its time to level up things, let's integrate an Agent to connect to a remote server using Jenkins.


## Pre-requisites
Let’s say we’re starting with a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 Linux installation. To get an agent working make sure you install Java ( same version as jenkins master server ) and Docker on it.

`
Note:-
While creating an agent, be sure to separate rights, permissions, and ownership for jenkins users. 
`

# Jenkins Master (Server)
Jenkins’s server or master node holds all key configurations. Jenkins master server is like a control server that orchestrates all the workflow defined in the pipelines. For example, scheduling a job, monitoring the jobs, etc.

# Jenkins Agent
Jenkins agents are the worker nodes that actually execute all the steps mentioned in a Job. When you create a Jenkins job, you have to assign an agent to it. Every agent has a label as a unique identifier.
When you trigger a Jenkins job from the master, the actual execution happens on the agent node that is configured in the job.
