# Day 44: EC2 and Auto Scaling 💻 📈
Today, we will be exploring two of the core services in AWS, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Auto Scaling, as part of the 90 Days of DevOps Challenge.

## Auto Scaling
Amazon Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. Auto Scaling can automatically increase or decrease the number of instances in response to changes in demand for your application.

## Task-01
- Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console and connect to it using SSH.
- Install a web server on the EC2 instance and deploy a simple web application.
- Monitor the EC2 instance using Amazon CloudWatch and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
## Task-02
- Create an Auto Scaling group using the AWS Management Console and configure it to launch EC2 instances in response to changes in demand.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the Auto Scaling group and the EC2 instances and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
- Use the AWS CLI to view the state of the Auto Scaling group and the EC2 instances and verify that the correct number of instances are running.
We hope that these tasks will give you hands-on experience with EC2 and Auto Scaling and help you understand how these services work together. If you have any questions or face any issues while doing the tasks, please let us know.

Happy Learning!
