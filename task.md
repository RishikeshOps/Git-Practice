# Day 5 Task: Basic Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers.


## What is Git?
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. It is commonly used for software development, but it can be used to track changes to any set of files.

With Git, you can keep a record of who made changes to what part of a file, and you can revert back to earlier versions of the file if needed. Git also makes it easy to collaborate with others, as you can share changes and merge the changes made by different people into a single version of a file.

## What is Github?
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and it offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. GitHub is a very popular platform for developers to share and collaborate on projects, and it is also used for hosting open-source projects.

## Task:

- Install Git on your computer (if it is not already installed). You can download it from the official website at https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Create a free account on GitHub (if you don't already have one). You can sign up at https://github.com/
- Learn the basics of Git by reading through the [video](https://youtu.be/AT1uxOLsCdk) This will give you an understanding of what Git is, how it works, and how to use it to track changes to files.

## Exercises:

1) Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine
2) Make some changes to a file in the repository and commit them to the repository using Git
3) Push the changes back to the repository on GitHub
