## Tasks
task-1: 
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Initialize a local Git repository on your computer and link it to the repository you just created on GitHub.
- Create a new file in your local repository and add some content to it.
- Commit the changes to your local repository.
- Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
- Go to the repository on GitHub and verify that the file and its contents are visible.
- Practice creating new branches, committing changes, and merging branches into the master branch.

task-2:
- Clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine using the git clone command.
- Create a new branch in the local repository using the **git branch** command.
- Make some changes to the code in the new branch and commit them to the branch using **git commit**.
- Check out the master branch using **git checkout** and make some conflicting changes to the code.
- Commit the changes to the master branch.
- Attempt to merge the new branch into the master branch using **git merge**.
- Resolve any merge conflicts that arise using a visual merge tool or by manually editing the conflicting files.
- Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the merged changes and push the updated master branch to the remote repository on GitHub using **git push**.


Note: These steps assume that you have already installed Git on your computer and have created a GitHub account. If you need help with these prerequisites, you can refer to the [day-08](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/ee7c53f276edb02a85a97282027028295be17c04/2023/day08/tasks.md)
